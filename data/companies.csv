We took the first step by building, alongside our staff of structural engineers, an in-house staff of steel detailers. Using 3D modeling software developed for steel fabricators, we found ourselves on the cutting edge of construction-grade BIM modeling before the term “BIM” existed. We have since built a company with bonding capability, and a track record of successful construction projects in which the same design engineering team carries the project through estimating, detailing, fabrication and erection of structural steel. There is no faster or more reliable process for steel construction than our integrated approach.

Our philosophy of personal responsibility has generated a corporate atmosphere of problem solving that embraces scopes of work that other structural engineers might be unable to serve. At the same time, our approach to steel design and construction has informed and energized our work in many other areas, including reinforced and post-tensioned concrete, heavy timber, multi-story stick frame, and masonry design, as well as emerging materials such as rammed earth, structural insulating panels, and structural glass. High design architects have responded with enthusiasm to our creative spirit, backed by engineering fundamentals and virtual building tools, as have designers of industrial structures and all manner of building types, urban and mountain, low or high budget.

Novus Architects took shape in 1992 – with one architect working for one new client. Strong, long-term relationships are the heart of what we do, and we never take for granted the trust clients place in us to listen intently to their needs, craft a custom process, gather a team with the right skills and passions – and together, bring to life spaces that serve people. 

Every day, we take our diverse interests and collective experiences and put them to work in wholly new ways – again and again. Because while we may carry the title of architect, planner, or designer, we see ourselves as consultants with an architectural perspective. The truth is, we do our best work when we challenge the notions of what an architect, designer, or planner can or should do and step beyond traditional roles to create new, unique processes that bring simplicity and clarity to the most complex projects.  

To build highly functional, beautiful spaces: medical facilities that nurture both physician and family, schools that inspire and engage both children and teacher, community centers that invite both dialogue and worship, is to constantly study how people move in and through spaces, how design influences human interaction, discovery, and deep connection.  

For us, that lifelong study is, like people themselves, always new, always challenging, and ever changing. So we focus on process, priorities, details, and communication. We embrace ingenuity, collaboration, and adaptation, because for us, a space is more than any hospital, school, or house of worship, it’s an always-new way of connecting and serving people.

Scott to provide structural engineering and management services to the construction industry. Initially, Norm offered a variety of marketing and management services, augmented by experts in various fields. However, the firm's continued work in the precast, prestressed concrete industry soon led to specialization in that field. Over the next few years, Jerry Goettsche, Les Martin and Armand Gustaferro joined the firm, adding more design capability. CEG experienced steady growth for the next several years. In 1982, an office was opened in San Antonio, Texas headed by Tom D'Arcy. Tom had considerable experience in the precast concrete industry, and was soon assembling a competent staff in precast concrete design, shop drawings and other structural engineering services. The ensuing years saw the scope of services greatly expand to include parking and transportation consulting services and concrete restoration engineering. CEG has been successfully involved in projects in virtually every state in the U. S., and in several foreign countries. CEG is a qualified Employee Stock Ownership (ESOP) company with all employees participating in that ownership. This will assure a smooth transition of ownership in the years ahead.

Our Mission Statement

People are CEG's most important assets. Fair and honest treatment of employees must be maintained at all costs. Professional growth and personal job satisfaction must be one of the most important goals of the firm.
A superior service is expected by our clients. By aiming for excellence the firm will attain the desired company goals. The objectives of our clients are also our objectives. CEG must continuously initiate and maintain services which will help clients with their objectives. The health and well being of concrete design and construction is essential to the success of CEG. Uncommon efforts must be devoted to advancing the industry.","Civil Engineering","51-200 employees","Privately Held","San Antonio, TX","United States","cegengineers.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/consulting-engineers-group-inc._2","People Search Updated","✅ Sent",,,,

■1956 – 1976 Frederick S. Landis, Founder & President

■1976 – 1987 Evelyn Landis Christman, Chairman of the Board

■1978 – 2015 James C. Landis, President & CEO

■2015 – present Anne Teague Landis, CEO

Frederick (Fred) settled in New Orleans with his wife Evelyn Landis following his service in World War II with the U.S. Corp of Engineers. After working in the local construction industry for Keller Construction Co. for a few years, he decided to venture out and start his own general contracting company.

Fred founded Landis Construction Co, Inc. in 1956 and began teaching the trade to his son James (Jim) Landis when he was just 14 years old, having him dig ditches and carry lumber on job sites.  Following Fred's premature death in 1976, a 34-year-old Jim Landis found himself at the helm of the company his dad had founded 25 years earlier. His widow Evelyn preserved the family leadership of the company by becoming Chairman of the Board for several years until 1978 when Jim officially took over as President and CEO. 

Anne Teague Landis began learning the administrative side of the company as young as Jim started learning the building side, working in the office during summer breaks. When Anne Teague joined Landis permanently in 2008, she began working side-by-side with her father to learn every aspect of the business. In 2015, Jim decided to step down as CEO and turn the company's management over to Anne Teague.

A female CEO in a largely male-dominated industry, Anne Teague has built upon her family’s legacy. Rooted in the same core values upon which it was founded 65 years ago, Landis continues to evolve, adapt, and grow, attributing its longevity and success to the relationships with its clients, subcontractors, community partners, and employees who boast an average tenure of more than a decade.","Construction","51-200 employees","Privately Held","New Orleans, LA","United States","landisllc.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/landisconstructionco","People Search Updated",,"✅ Sent",,,

That is how the sizes in cloths, that we know today, came into being. At a tie when only the rich had their tailors and dress-makers, he was a precursor in believing in the burgeoning democratization of cloths and, together with his associate and designer, Siegel, he started to manufacture busts and dummies to be used in the ready-to-wear trade and by couturiers.

Thus the famous “Stockman's” can be seen in Haute Couture windows and workshops all over the world, but the refinement goes further than that. It is not ordinary standard bust. For that purpose, we work with big fashion houses such as Jean-Paul Gautier, Dior and Saint-Laurent and we enlarge the bust or slim down the waist and hips of our dummies according to fashion trends. Two sculptures work for us and shape the bust”.

Every year, more than 5,000 busts intended for haute couture and 100,000 tailor's dummies leave the workshops in Gennevilliers to be used in show windows all over the world. “The market has grown considerably and small shops have been replaced by chain stores such as Gap. So we have to modify our sales strategy. We now have a subsidiary in the United States and we are about to invest in Japan and in Great Britain, two big markets.""

At Siegel & Stockman, without displaying frenzied, unconscious optimism, people feel confident and sure of their know-how. “Our strength lies in our being able to manufacture different products, with different shapes of figures, or with wooden or metal feet, according to the wishes of the customers and to make moulds corresponding exactly to their demands. For two years, in addition to haute couture busts made of papier-mâché covered in cotton. We have created a resin model which is faster to manufacture, thereby increasing our production capacity.”","Design Services","51-200 employees","Self Owned","New York","United States","siegel-stockman.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/siegel-stockman","People Search Updated",,,"✅ Sent",,

The process of using light gauge steel in construction is supported in multiple extensive studies by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in association with Partnership for Advanced Technology in Housing (PATH) and the Manufactured Housing Research Alliance. One of the whitepapers is titled the Design for a Cold-Formed Steel Framed Manufactured Home, & available online at: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pdf/sfmh_rpt.pdf 

A follow up study by the group titled Steel Framing Prototype Development: Final Report, further solidified the structural and cost benefits of cold formed steel (CFS) housing construction. That report is available at: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/SteelReport.pdf 

Residential and commercial construction techniques & technologies have evolved to an extent where 100% engineered structures are producible faster, more safely and accurately & with greater structural integrity than traditional methodologies.

The University of California San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering put a six-story, lightweight CFS building through a series of scaled motion earthquakes. The purpose of the tests was to see if it was possible to withstand a historic earthquake combined with an ensuing fire in a multi-story, multi-family structure. Test results proved that CFS could not only withstand the earthquakes & fire, but also could be built much more efficiently than traditional wood or concrete structures.

Most of the invitations available in the market were very traditional, and my clients were looking for invitations that were fun and fashionable- more representative of themselves. I have always had a ""passion for fashion"" (having worked with designer Diane Von Furstenberg after college), so I was thrilled to be able to combine my expertise in wedding planning with my love for fashion, and custom design creative invitations for my clients.  In 2002, when pregnant with my fist child, I launched my own stylish stationery company, the Bonnie Marcus Collection ""where fashion meets paper,"" and the excitement hasn't stopped since!

Today (twelve years and three children later) the Bonnie Marcus Collection is going strong!  Our designs have been featured in many major publications, including New York Magazine, ""O"" The Oprah Magazine, Modern Bride, Pregnancy, People, InStyle, Glamour, and most recently on TODAY with Hoda and Kathie Lee.  We are fortunate to have developed a strong celebrity following, and have enjoyed working with Brittney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Katherine Heigl, Cindy Crawford, Molly Sims, Marcia Cross, Angie Harmon, and many others on their most special events. 

Whether you are planning your special wedding day, preparing for a new baby, or planning a celebratory soiree, we are thrilled to be able to provide you with a broad collection of fabulous invitations that will set the tone for your very special day.

Since 1960, our main focus has been owner-developed & occupied facilities, where the people who pay the bills get to see firsthand the results. A few of our differentiators:  

-Over 60% of our office staff have engineering or computer science degrees.

-60-80% of our construction work is either design/build or design/assist. The resulting culture is solution, not change order, oriented. A company owner is involved with every project. 

-Our engineering department is technically advanced, while also living the field side of how buildings are built. Every Western Allied design is constructible and maintainable, and our engineers retain contact with the buildings they design throughout construction and commissioning…and often for decades thereafter.  

-Our controls group is not a separate profit center or company. Everyone at Western Allied has access to the best controls people in Southern California. There are no better systems integrators or multi-protocol masters anywhere. 

-Over 65% of our service techs are full journeymen or foremen, double most of the other big service groups. We provide value, responding with people who are capable of diagnosing &  resolving the problem. Our area managers average 35 years of HVAC industry experience; no rookies here.

-80% of our service accounts are in owner-occupied facilities. 

-No one at Western Allied is paid commission, or benefits personally at the cost of a client, or  specific project. 

-Our ownership transition plan works. We are a model for stable, consistent company goals, professional company officers and  minimal management drama. We have never had a “reorganization”, initiated by the latest manager brought in from somewhere else.  

-The Western Allied family enjoys our jobs, our careers and each other. We enjoy coming to work and enjoy the work that we produce.","Construction","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Santa Fe Springs","United States","wasocal.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/western-allied-corporation","People Search Updated",,,,"✅ Sent",

Howe Electric began as a small electrical contracting business in 1949 in Fresno, California. It was incorporated ten years later as Howe Electric, Inc. By the 1980s, the business had grown into a leader in design-build construction and large scale public works projects by adding design-build services and an in-house engineering division. In 2007, an employee stock ownership plan was formed, and the business took on its current name – Howe Electric Construction, Inc. 

Howe Electric Construction, Inc. is an expert in Medical, Education, Government, Commercial and Specialty projects. We have worked both nationally and internationally, forming long-term client relationships and maintaining a steady record of safety, quality craftsmanship and integrity. 

Today we celebrate 70 years as one of the largest electrical contractors in Central California. We keep a piece of our history by occupying the same building we’ve been in since 1949.

WE ARE BUILDERS. We are passionate about our work. Our mission is to be the best. We provide our clients with quality and excellence.

We thrive on that moment when our customers walk through the doors of their new or renovated facilities and they look around and smile. That smile is worth the hard work, team effort, dedication, long hours, and the thoughtful, planned processes that are a part of every project we have so much fun building.

Our mission simply stated...is to make you smile.

OUR HISTORY: 
The year 1929 wasn’t the best time to start a construction business. With America on the brink of the Great Depression, work was scarce, standards were high, and success would only come to firms with exceptional integrity and dependability.

But those are exactly just the qualities that Charles Langhorne Lewis brought to his new company...and before long, his reputation was as solid as his work.  By the 1950’s, C. L. Lewis & Company was one of the leading contractors in Central Virginia.

Today the company’s experience has grown to encompass every major category of commercial building. And while we’re proud of our past, we don’t live there. After all, a company doesn’t stay in business over three-quarters of a century without keeping up with the times. The construction techniques of yesteryear have given way to web-based project management, building information modeling (BIM) & virtualization.","Construction","51-200 employees","Privately Held","Lynchburg, VA","United States","jamersonlewis.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jamerson-lewisconstructioninc","People Search Updated",,,,"✅ Sent",

History 

Clifford A. King started King Company in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1932. The company began as an interiors specialty construction company in the commercial marketplace. King Company experienced steady growth through the years to become one of the most highly regarded contractors in the region. When Mr. King retired in 1954, he sold the interiors portion of King Company to one of his longtime employees, Cy Geary. Mr. Geary had formerly served in the United States Marine Corps in World War II. During his service to his country, he received two Distinguished Flying Crosses. 
Mr. Geary continued to own and operate the company until his retirement in 1995, at which time, his sons, Cyd and Jeff, took over the operation. Cyd Geary started his career with King Company in 1975 and Jeff Geary started in 1982.  Since then, King Company has continued to keep the level of performance and professionalism at a very high level.","Construction","201-500 employees","Partnership","New Orleans, LA","United States","kingcolp.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/king-company-l-p-","People Search Updated",,,,"✅ Sent",

,"2025-07-25T13:00:41.403Z","2025-07-28T11:48:33.988Z","CreativeBathSystems","Creative Bath Systems is owned and operated by Bob and Jim, two brothers who have been working together in bathroom remodeling since high school. Bob and Jim learned all about remodeling and home building from their father, an architectural designer who taught them and who still works in the old traditional way. Lucky for Creative Bath Systems, their father brings years of experience as well as beautiful design work that meets city planning requirements and is completed quickly and professionally.

Jim and Bob have 60 combined years of hands-on experience themselves. Jim was a master trim carpenter for 20 years, specializing in round stairways, cabinets, bookcases and custom decks. You can expect only the best from both of them, as their many years of experience working in the trade guarantees hassle-free work and beautiful results.

Bob and Jim personally manage each project from beginning to end. They will be there for the first meeting, the estimate, the signing of contracts, consultations on architectural designs if needed, and the building of your project from start to finish. Because Bob and Jim supervise every project themselves, there is no need to pay more money for site supervisors or contractors. With Creative Bath Systems, you pay as little as possible.

Being on site every step of the way allows Bob and Jim to keep your project on schedule, also allowing them to ensure that you get the highest quality of work. Being there every day allows them to be available to answer your questions, listen to your needs and work with you to build your dreams exactly the way you want. They understand how hard you work for your money – they work as hard as you do to ensure you get exactly what you’re paying for.","Construction","51-200 employees","Public Company","Northfield, Ohio","United States","creativebathsystems.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/creativebathsystems","People Search Updated",,,,"✅ Sent",

Artisans in all Metals

One hundred years have brought tremendous change to the state of California, especially with infrastructure, buildings, and facilities. In that time, Washington Iron Works has evolved from a small fabricator and installer of fire escapes and ornamental gates to the premier provider of miscellaneous and architectural metals for the building trades in this region. The name evolved from the original shop location on Washington Boulevard close to downtown Los Angeles. Time and growth required two moves from the original location, and the shop facility is now located on six and a half acres in the City of Carson. The all Union workforce (Shop & Field) has also grown from a small operation of twelve people to a medium size corporation of two hundred fifty. The key to success as a construction “job shop” is the knowledge and experience of the people working in the office, shop, and field. The majority of Washington Iron’s people are long-term employees, with an average tenure of over twenty years.

Signature projects completed by Washington Iron include: the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the San Francisco New Main Library, the Getty Villa in Malibu, the Getty Villa Renovation, the Staples Center, LA Live!, the Kodak Theater at Hollywood & Highland, the San Diego Convention Center Phases I & II, the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, the Escondido Performing Arts Center, American Airlines Terminal 4 Expansion at LAX, the Oakland - Alameda County Coliseum Expansion, and The Christ Cathedral renovation.","Construction","201-500 employees","Privately Held","Gardena, CA","United States","washingtoniron.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/washingtonironworks","People Search Updated",,,,,"✅ Sent"
