Design work will begin within a framework that outlines design tasks and requirements; identifies specific responsibilities for design, including those of the architects, its engineers, the client and possible other third parties; establishes a schedule including starting and completion dates; and defines design phases and deliverables with interim milestone dates tied to owner approval to proceed. 

An important aspect of the architect’s service is to provide project management focusing on four interrelated design management activities: managing teams, operations, controls, and disputes. 

Delawie currently uses the latest software and tools, including Revit Architecture 2009, which provides BIM models that are shared with engineers and contractors. 

We will work with the client at the project outset to develop a detailed project plan which corresponds to each project phase.
